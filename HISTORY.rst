* Fixed a bug where the channel_number and client_uuid were not being added to the chunks.m3u8 link after hijacking the Nimble session

1.2.1 (01-03-2018)
------------------
* Code refactoring and various bug fixes

1.2.0 (28-02-2018)
------------------
* Added nimble session "hijacking"
    * The chunks.m3u8 link returned by SmoothStreams contains 2 parameters (nimblesessionid & wmsAuthSign)
    * wmsAuthSign is the authorization hash
    * The chunks.m3u8 link is only updated if a user switches to a different channel. As long as the same channel is being watched, the same chunks.m3u8 link is being used
    * As a result if the authorization hash expires while a channel is being watched the stream will stop until the user switches channels to retrieve a new authorization hash
    * The functionality added is to prevent this from happening by manipulating the values of the 2 parameters (nimblesessionid & wmsAuthSign) to valid values
* Code refactoring and various bug fixes

1.1.0 (27-02-2018)
------------------
* Added validations when parsing the configuration file along with error messages
* Added a timer that will automatically retrieve a new authorization hash
    * The timer will trigger 45 seconds before the authorization hash is set to expire
    * If a new authorization hash is retrieved by a client request (As a result of a request to http://<hostname>:<port>/playlist.m3u8?channel_number=XX) then the current timer is cancelled and a new timer is initiated
* Added watchdog functionality that will monitor the configuration file for modifications
* Added functionality to obfuscate/encrypt the password in the configuration file following the first run
* Lots of refactoring and various bug fixes

1.0.0 (24-02-2018)
